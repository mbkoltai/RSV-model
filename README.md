# Inferring the role of age versus immunity in susceptibility to RSV infection by modelling RSV resurgence

Code for modelling RSV resurgence after COVID-19-related Nonpharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) and how it can be used to infer the dependence of susceptibility to RSV infection on age versus immunity acquired by previous infections.
